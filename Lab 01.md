## Lab 01 | Environment Setup

Step 1: Assign net0 to the WAN, which should not have your name assigned to it. Then, for net1, you should assign it to the LAN, which should have your name assigned to it.

WAN MAC Address:

My WAN and LAN are either missing network configuration information or contain default IP addresses. Now is when we put them in

First, press 1 to configure the names of the WAN and LAN. Make sure MAC Addresses match up correctly. Say no to setting up VLANS first. Make sure vtnet0 is WAN and vtnet1 is LAN.
